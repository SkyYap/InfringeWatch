# üõ°Ô∏è Infringewatch

> A decentralized protocol for monitoring, detecting, and enforcing intellectual property (IP) rights across digital platforms using AI and DePIN infrastructure.

---

## üß© Problem Statement

Intellectual Property (IP) creators often suffer from unauthorized use, reposting, and plagiarism across the internet. Centralized enforcement systems are inefficient, costly and limited in scope. InfringeWatch empowers creators with decentralized tools to monitor and enforce IP rights in real-time using community validation, AI-driven scanning, and on-chain transparency.

## üöÄ Features

- **Decentralized IP Monitoring**
  - Leverages a distributed network of users to detect copyright/IP infringement in recorded content.

- **AI-Powered Infringement Detection**
  - Utilizes local machine learning models to scan recordings for unauthorized use of creative works.

- **Privacy-Preserving Local Processing**
  - Users can process data on their own GPU/CPU ‚Äî no raw media is uploaded to centralized servers.

- **Tokenized Incentives**
  - Contributors are rewarded with tokens for:
    - Uploading recordings
    - Running AI models
    - Validating AI results
    - Referring new participants

- **Referral & Community Growth Tools**
  - Built-in dashboard for referrals, with tracking and reward distribution.

- **Open Contribution Model**
  - Anyone can join as a node, contribute training data, or improve models to make infringement detection smarter.

- **User-Friendly Web Dashboard**
  - A streamlined interface to manage recordings, run scans, earn rewards, and grow the network.

## üìä DePIN Dashboard

A minimal and powerful dashboard with four main modules:

1. **üé• Recording Manager**
   - Upload and view your screen/audio recordings
   - Tag content with IP categories (e.g. artwork, script, music)

2. **üß† Local Processing**
   - Run AI infringement models on your own device (GPU/CPU)
   - Validate matches locally to contribute without data leaving your device

3. **üí∞ Rewards Console**
   - Earn tokens for:
     - Uploading training data
     - Running AI inference
     - Validating IP violations
   - Track earnings, contribution stats, and task history

4. **üì¢ Referral Dashboard**
   - Invite others to join as DePIN nodes or validators
   - Monitor referral signups, rewards, and community impact

## üß™ Local Setup

To set up Infringewatch on your local device:

1. **Download the `.exe` Installer**
   - Visit our [Releases](https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/releases) page to get the latest `.exe` file.
   - This installer will automatically fetch the latest build from ScreenPipe.

2. **Install the Infringewatch Plugin**
   - Once ScreenPipe is installed, open the app and go to the **AI App Store**.
   - Search for **Infringewatch** and click **Install**.

That's it! You‚Äôre now ready to:
- Upload or record media
- Scan content using local AI models
- Start earning rewards

## üå± Future Development Ideas

1. **IP ownership report** ‚Äì Creators can subscribe to the real-time monitoring service and get alert on infringement on their registered IP.
2. **Decentralized arbitration DAO** ‚Äì Allow community to vote on disputes or false positives.
3. **Real-time video scanning support** ‚Äì For live streams and time-based watermark detection.
4. **Cross-platform integration APIs** ‚Äì Plug directly into Story Protocol, YouTube, TikTok etc. for takedown automation.
5. **Creator reward pool** ‚Äì Pay creators when infringers are penalized via bounty capture.
